# monads

Short project explaining monad usage for parsing 

No general monad abstractions are used, attention is to flatMap, map and 
syntactic suger for for comprehensions. I want to show how this monad thing
lets create expressive API's.

It is possible to add a few more helper functions and make EBNF grammars in code
to look almost the same as theoretical ebnf descriptions. This was not done as
I just wanted to demonstrate applicability of monads.

Project can be tested by cloning and lauching sbt in project directory.
Even simpler option is to import using intellij IDEA.
