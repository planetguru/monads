# monads

Short project explaining monad usage for parsing 

No general monad abstractions are used, attention is to flatMap, map and 
syntactic suger for for comprehensions. I want to show how this monad thing
lets create expressive API's.

Project can be tested by cloning and lauching sbt in project directory.
Even simpler option is to import using intellij IDEA.
